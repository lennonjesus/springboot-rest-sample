# springboot-rest-sample

A very, very, very, very simple Spring Boot Project to demonstrate how to consume a REST service from another 
server/domain/url using JQuery or AngularJS (or Pure Javascript, if you prefer)


The files under the static folder can be used out of project as a static html files or in another server (in another port) for tests.
